## Task ID: 2 - embeddings-ui-restructure
### Work Task
Rewrite `src/components/embeddings/embeddings-settings-panel.tsx` to: (1) move the "Upload & Create Embeddings" collapsible section into a new "Archivos" tab, (2) translate all English UI text to Spanish, (3) update tab layout to 4 columns, (4) remove unused `uploadSectionOpen` state.

### Work Summary
- Moved the entire file upload section (previously a standalone Collapsible between Chat Integration and Tabs) into a new TabsContent with value="archivos"
- Tabs now have 4 items: Búsqueda (Search), Archivos (Files), Namespaces, Examinar (Browse) with `grid-cols-4`
- Added `archivos` case to `handleTabChange` function to reload namespaces
- Removed `uploadSectionOpen` state variable and its `Collapsible` wrapper
- Translated all user-facing strings to Spanish including: header banner, config section labels/buttons/toast messages, upload section labels/buttons/placeholders, search tab, namespaces tab, browse tab, all 3 dialogs (Create Embedding, Create Namespace, Reset All), SPLITTER_OPTIONS constants, and the EmbeddingsChatIntegration sub-component
- Preserved all imports, interfaces, types, constants structure, API calls, state management, and component logic
- File reduced from 1724 to 1712 lines (removed Collapsible wrapper overhead)
- ESLint passes with zero errors

## Task ID: 3 - embeddings-reliability-fixes
### Work Task
Fix three reliability issues in the embeddings system: (1) config persistence and client singleton reset, (2) auto-create namespace on file upload, (3) search always uses latest persisted config and model.

### Work Summary
**Config persistence (already working):**
- Verified config saves to `data/embeddings-config.json` via `config-persistence.ts` `saveConfig()`
- Verified `loadConfig()` reads from disk on server restart
- Verified `PUT /api/embeddings/config` correctly invalidates cache, saves to disk, and resets client singleton
- Tested full round-trip: save → verify on disk → read via API — all consistent

**Bug fix: Ollama client singleton stale model (`ollama-client.ts`, `client.ts`):**
- Added `resetOllamaClient()` export to `ollama-client.ts` that sets `ollamaClientInstance = null`
- Updated `resetEmbeddingClient()` in `client.ts` to call `resetOllamaClient()` before creating new client, ensuring a fresh Ollama client with the latest model on every config change
- Before fix: `resetEmbeddingClient` only updated the existing singleton's config, which could lead to stale model being used for embedding generation

**Bug fix: Search uses wrong model (`client.ts` searchSimilar):**
- Added model drift detection: before embedding the search query, compares current client model against persisted config model
- If models differ, resets Ollama client and creates fresh one with persisted config
- Search now always loads `maxResults` and `similarityThreshold` from persisted config (not just defaults)
- Before fix: if model was changed without server restart, search would embed query with old model causing dimension mismatch

**Bug fix: Namespace not auto-created on file upload (`create-from-file/route.ts`):**
- Added `client.upsertNamespace({ namespace })` call before creating embeddings from file
- Before fix: if the selected namespace didn't exist in the namespaces table, embeddings were stored with a namespace field that had no corresponding record, making the namespace tab show inconsistent counts

---
## Task ID: 4 - embeddings-examinar-layout-and-search-fix
### Work Task
Fix two issues: (1) Examinar tab embeddings overlapping on refresh, (2) Search not returning results because silent error handling bug and model mismatch.

### Work Summary

**Fix 1: Examinar tab overlapping display (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Added `refreshingEmbeddings` state variable for loading indicator during refresh
- Created `refreshEmbeddingsTab()` function that sets loading state, calls all three data loaders, then clears loading
- Updated `handleTabChange` to use `refreshEmbeddingsTab()` for the embeddings tab
- Replaced `ScrollArea` with direct `max-h-[400px] overflow-y-auto` div for better scroll containment
- Added loading spinner with "Cargando embeddings..." text while refreshing
- "Actualizar" button now shows spinner and is disabled during refresh

**Fix 2: Silent error handling bug in search (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- **Critical bug found**: `handleSearch()` checked `data.success` but had NO `else` branch — server errors (500) were silently ignored!
- Added `else` branch that shows error toast with `data.error` message from server
- This means users can now see actual Ollama connection errors, model not found errors, etc.

**Fix 3: Search uses configured Ollama model (`search/route.ts`, `create-from-file/route.ts`, `embeddings/route.ts`):**
- Updated search route to explicitly reset the embedding client before every search, ensuring the persisted config model is used
- Added model mismatch warning logging when frontend-sent model differs from persisted config
- Search response now includes `meta` object with model, threshold, limit, namespace for transparency
- Updated `create-from-file` route to reset client with persisted config before creating embeddings
- Updated main `POST /api/embeddings` route to reset client with persisted config before creating single embeddings
- Frontend now passes `model: config.model` in search request body as a safety check

**Fix 4: Search metadata display (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Added `SearchMeta` interface for type safety
- Added `searchMeta` state to store search response metadata
- Search results header now shows badges with "Modelo: X" and "Umbral: Y%" for user transparency

## Task ID: 5 - lanceDB-dimension-mismatch-fix
### Work Task
Fix LanceDB error "No vector column found to match with the query vector dimension: 768" when user switches embedding model from 1024D to 768D (nomic-embed-text-v2-moe).

### Root Cause
LanceDB table schema is immutable once created. The embeddings table was created with 1024D vectors (bge-m3:567m model). When user switched to nomic-embed-text-v2-moe (768D), the search query vector (768D) couldn't match the table's 1024D vector column.

### Work Summary

**Fix 1: Added nomic-embed-text-v2-moe to KNOWN_MODELS (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Model uses Matryoshka Embeddings with flexible dimensions 256-768 (default 768)
- Added both `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` and `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe:latest` entries with dimension 768

**Fix 2: LanceDB auto-detect and recreate table on dimension mismatch (`lancedb-db.ts`):**
- Added `tableDimension` tracker variable to track current table's vector dimension
- Added `getTableDimension()` export for external dimension checking
- Modified `initializeTables()` to read the first row's vector after opening existing table
- If existing vector dimension differs from config dimension, automatically drops and recreates the table
- Also drops namespace-specific tables that might have wrong dimensions
- Empty tables are also recreated to ensure correct schema
- Added `forceReinit` parameter to `initLanceDB()` to bypass cached initialization check
- `closeLanceDB()` now resets `tableDimension` tracker

**Fix 3: Config save triggers LanceDB reinit (`config/route.ts`):**
- On PUT, compares old vs new model/dimension to detect dimension-affecting changes
- Calls `initLanceDB(undefined, true)` with force flag when model/dimension changed
- Response includes `meta` object with `modelChanged`, `dimensionChanged`, `dimensionMismatch`, `oldDimension`, `newDimension`
- GET response now includes `tableDimension` for UI comparison

**Fix 4: UI dimension mismatch warning (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Added `tableDimension` to `EmbeddingConfig` interface
- Save handler now reads response meta and shows contextual toast messages
- Dimension mismatch: "Tabla de embeddings recreada" with specific dimension change info
- Model change (same dimension): Warning about potential incompatibility
- Added amber warning banner in config section when `tableDimension !== config.dimension`
- Banner says "Incompatibilidad de dimensiones detectada" with explanation and fix instruction

## Task ID: 6 - embeddings-chat-integration-verification
### Work Task
Verify and fix embeddings chat integration in normal chat, group chat, and regenerate when "integración con chat" is enabled in configuration.

### Work Summary

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ **Normal chat (stream route)**: Fully implemented — `retrieveEmbeddingsContext()` called, context injected into system prompt, SSE `embeddings_context` event sent, shown in prompt viewer
- ✅ **Group chat (group-stream route)**: Fully implemented — per-character embedding retrieval using each responder's ID, context injected into per-character system prompt, SSE event with `characterId`
- ❌ **Regenerate route**: Was completely missing embeddings integration

**Bug fix: Regenerate route missing embeddings integration (`regenerate/route.ts`, `chat-panel.tsx`):**

Frontend (`chat-panel.tsx`):
- Added `characterId: activeCharacter?.id` to regenerate fetch body
- Added `embeddingsChat: settings.embeddingsChat` to regenerate fetch body (was missing — other handlers had it)
- Added `summary: currentSession?.summary` for memory/context compression support

Backend (`regenerate/route.ts`):
- Added imports: `EmbeddingsChatSettings` type, `retrieveEmbeddingsContext()`, `formatEmbeddingsForSSE()`
- Added `characterId`, `embeddingsChat`, `summary` to validation function and destructuring
- Added embeddings context retrieval using the **last user message before the assistant message** as search query
- Added embeddings section to `allPromptSections` array (between system sections and chat history)
- Created `finalSystemPrompt` variable that appends embeddings context to base system prompt
- Replaced all `systemPrompt` references in LLM provider switch with `finalSystemPrompt` (z-ai, openai, anthropic, ollama, text-generation-webui)
- Added `embeddings_context` SSE event transmission for frontend UI display
- Added server-side logging when embeddings are found

**Impact:**
- Before fix: Regenerating a message would produce a different response because the original had embeddings context but the regeneration did not
- After fix: Regeneration uses the same embeddings context as the original message, producing consistent results

## Task ID: 7 - embeddings-context-position-and-editor-layout
### Work Task
(1) Move embeddings [CONTEXTO] section to appear right after "User's Persona" in the prompt. (2) Adjust character and group editor layouts for full-screen mode.

### Work Summary

**Part 1: Embeddings CONTEXTO position in prompt:**
- Changed label from `'Embeddings Context'` to `'CONTEXTO'` in `chat-context.ts`
- Removed `[Relevant Context from Embeddings]` prefix from `buildContextString()` — now only the embedding entries appear
- Updated all 3 routes (`stream`, `group-stream`, `regenerate`) to insert embeddings section after "User's Persona" using `findIndex('persona')` + split
- Section only appears if embeddings were found (conditional spread)

**Part 2: Editor layout adjustments for full-screen:**

Character Editor (`character-editor.tsx`):
- Added `max-w-5xl mx-auto` wrapper inside the main scrollable content area
- Made Info tab name/tags grid responsive: `grid-cols-3` → `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`
- Made Description tab grid responsive: `grid-cols-3` → `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3`, col-span updated to `lg:col-span-2`
- Made Dialogue tab grid responsive: `grid-cols-2` → `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`
- Made Prompts tab grid responsive: `grid-cols-2` → `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`

Group Editor (`group-editor.tsx`):
- Added `max-w-5xl mx-auto` wrapper inside the main scrollable content area
- Changed member list heights from hardcoded `max-h-[500px]` to viewport-relative `max-h-[60vh]`
- Grid layouts already had responsive `lg:` breakpoints (no changes needed)

Settings Panel: Already well-structured, kept as reference (no changes)

---
## Task ID: 8 - embedding-namespace-assignment
### Work Task
Add namespace selection to Character and Group editors so each can specify which embedding namespaces to search during chat, overriding the global strategy.

### Work Summary

**Types (`src/types/index.ts`):**
- Added `embeddingNamespaces?: string[]` field to `CharacterCard` interface
- Added `embeddingNamespaces?: string[]` field to `CharacterGroup` interface
- Added `customNamespaces?: string[]` field to `EmbeddingsChatSettings` interface

**New Component (`src/components/tavern/namespace-selector.tsx`):**
- Created `NamespaceSelector` component following same pattern as `QuestSelector`/`LorebookSelector`
- Fetches available namespaces from `GET /api/embeddings/namespaces` on mount
- Multi-select dropdown with checkboxes, badges showing selected namespaces with embedding counts
- Shows description and embedding count per namespace
- "Limpiar" button to clear all selections
- Info text: "Sin seleccionar — se usará la estrategia definida en la configuración"
- Handles states: loading, DB unavailable, empty namespaces

**Character Editor (`src/components/tavern/character-editor.tsx`):**
- Added `NamespaceSelector` to the "Asignaciones" section after Quest selector
- Uses `character.embeddingNamespaces` as value, updates via `setCharacter`
- Icon: `Database` in violet color

**Group Editor (`src/components/tavern/group-editor.tsx`):**
- Added `NamespaceSelector` to the "Asignaciones" section after Quest selector
- Added `embeddingNamespaces` to initial values extraction from existing group
- Added state: `const [embeddingNamespaces, setEmbeddingNamespaces]`
- Included in `handleSave` data payload

**Chat Context Logic (`src/lib/embeddings/chat-context.ts`):**
- Updated `retrieveEmbeddingsContext()` to check for `settings.customNamespaces` first
- If `customNamespaces` is provided and non-empty, it overrides the strategy-based namespace resolution
- Falls back to `getNamespacesForStrategy()` when no custom namespaces are set

**Frontend Chat Integration (`src/components/tavern/chat-panel.tsx`):**
- Normal chat: passes `customNamespaces: activeCharacter?.embeddingNamespaces` in embeddingsChat
- Group chat: passes `customNamespaces: activeGroup?.embeddingNamespaces` in embeddingsChat
- Both merge with spread: `{...settings.embeddingsChat, customNamespaces: ...}`

---
## Task ID: 9 - group-chat-character-namespace-fallback
### Work Task
In group chat, if the group has no custom embedding namespaces, fall back to each responding character's own namespaces when that character generates a response.

### Work Summary

**File changed:** `src/app/api/chat/group-stream/route.ts`

**Logic added (per-character loop, around line 495):**
- Check `group.embeddingNamespaces` (group-level override)
- If group has namespaces → use those for all characters
- If group has NO namespaces → check `responder.embeddingNamespaces` (character-level)
- If character has namespaces → use those
- If neither has namespaces → use global strategy (default behavior)

```typescript
const effectiveEmbeddingsChat = (groupNamespaces?.length > 0)
  ? { ...embeddingsChat, customNamespaces: groupNamespaces }
  : (characterNamespaces?.length > 0)
    ? { ...embeddingsChat, customNamespaces: characterNamespaces }
    : embeddingsChat;
```

**Priority chain for group chat:**
| Priority | Source | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Group namespaces | Group has `embeddingNamespaces` set |
| 2 | Character namespaces | Group has none, character has `embeddingNamespaces` |
| 3 | Global strategy | Neither group nor character has namespaces |

## Task ID: 10 - avatar-file-storage-and-group-avatar
### Work Task
(1) Change character avatar upload from base64 to file-based storage via /api/upload. (2) Add avatar upload capability to group editor.

### Work Summary

**Character Editor (`src/components/tavern/character-editor.tsx`):**
- Replaced `FileReader.readAsDataURL()` (base64) with `fetch('/api/upload')` POST
- File is now saved to `public/uploads/avatar/{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- Avatar value stored in JSON is now a relative URL (`/uploads/avatar/...`) instead of a base64 data URL
- Increased max size from 2MB to 5MB
- Added image type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Existing base64 avatars (from imported characters) continue to work since `<img src>` accepts both formats

**Group Editor (`src/components/tavern/group-editor.tsx`):**
- Added avatar upload UI with click-to-upload pattern
- Added states: `avatarUploading`, `avatarUrl`, `avatarFileInputRef`
- Added `handleAvatarUpload()` function using `fetch('/api/upload')` with type `group-avatar`
- Updated avatar display: shows uploaded image, loading spinner, or gradient fallback with Users icon
- Added hover overlay with Camera icon for visual feedback
- Updated `handleSave` to use `avatarUrl` state instead of `existingGroup?.avatar`
- Without custom avatar: shows gradient with Users icon (same as before)
- Text: "Clic para subir avatar" / "Avatar del grupo (clic para cambiar)"

**Impact on persistence:**
- `data/characters.json`: New character avatars are lightweight URLs (~50 chars) instead of base64 (~500KB-2MB)
- `data/groups.json`: Groups now store avatar URL when uploaded, empty string when not

---
## Task ID: 11 - character-editor-selection-fix
### Work Task
Fix character editor not loading correct character data (name, avatar, etc.) when editing an existing character.

### Work Summary

**Root Cause:**
- `CharacterEditor` in `character-panel.tsx` had no `key` prop, so React reused the same component instance when switching between characters
- `useState(getInitialCharacter)` only runs once at mount, so switching `characterId` while the component was mounted would not update the form data
- Compare: `GroupEditor` already had `key={editingGroupId || 'new-group'}` and worked correctly

**Fix (`src/components/tavern/character-panel.tsx`):**
- Added `key={editingCharacterId || 'new-character'}` to `CharacterEditor` component
- This forces React to fully unmount and remount the editor when the character ID changes
- All fields (name, avatar, description, tags, etc.) now correctly load from the store for the selected character

**Before:** Opening editor for Character A, closing, then opening for Character B would show Character A's data
**After:** Each character edit opens with the correct character's data loaded fresh

---
## Task ID: 12 - namespace-type-grouping
### Work Task
Add "Tipo" (Type) field to namespaces so embeddings are grouped by type in the LLM prompt with headers like [MEMORIA DEL PERSONAJE], [EVENTOS RECIENTES], [LORE DEL MUNDO].

### Work Summary

**Namespace Type Field (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Added `type?: string` to `NamespaceRecord` interface
- Added `type` to `newNamespace` state and `editingNamespace` state
- Create Namespace Dialog: Added "Tipo" dropdown with 5 predefined types + custom option:
  - 🧠 Memoria del Personaje
  - 📅 Eventos Recientes
  - 🌍 Lore del Mundo
  - ⚙️ Reglas y Mecánicas
  - 👥 Relaciones
  - ✏️ Tipo personalizado (free-form input)
- Edit Namespace Dialog: New dialog for editing type/description of existing namespaces (name is read-only)
- Added edit button (Pencil icon) to each namespace in the list
- Type stored in namespace's `metadata.type` field (LanceDB JSON column)
- `loadNamespaces()` extracts `type` from `metadata.type` for display
- Type badge shown next to namespace name with violet styling

**Grouped Context Format (`chat-context.ts`):**
- Complete rewrite of `buildContextString()` → `buildGroupedContextString()`
- New `getNamespaceTypesMap()` function loads namespace type info from LanceDB
- Embeddings grouped by namespace type into sections with `[TYPE]` headers
- Each entry formatted as `- content` (bullet list style) instead of `[source_type] content`
- Format example:
  ```
  [CONTEXTO RELEVANTE]

  [MEMORIA DEL PERSONAJE]
  - Alvar recuerda que el jugador sobrevivió varias expediciones peligrosas.
  - Alvar sospecha que el jugador evita pagar sus deudas.

  [EVENTOS RECIENTES]
  - Un grupo desapareció en el bosque al norte del pueblo.
  ```
- Results without a type go into `[OTRO CONTEXTO]` section (or plain list if no types exist at all)
- Token budget respected across all groups
- `EmbeddingsContextResult` now includes `typeGroups?: Record<string, number>` for UI display
- `formatEmbeddingsForSSE()` updated to include `typeGroups` in SSE events

**Type Fix (`types/index.ts`):**
- Added `'memory'` to `PromptSection.type` union (was missing, causing type mismatch)

**Impact:**
- Namespaces can now be categorized by type for organized context injection
- Multiple namespaces can share the same type for merged grouping
- LLM receives well-structured, grouped context instead of flat list
- Existing namespaces without a type continue to work (grouped as "OTRO CONTEXTO" or ungrouped)

---
## Task ID: 13 - memory-extraction-phase1
### Work Task
Implement Phase 1 of automatic memory extraction: LLM-powered fact extraction from chat messages, robust JSON parsing, embedding storage, and integration into chat routes + UI settings.

### Work Summary

**Memory Extraction Utility (`src/lib/embeddings/memory-extraction.ts`) - NEW:**
- `extractMemories()` — Calls LLM with extraction prompt to analyze last assistant message
- `saveMemoriesAsEmbeddings()` — Saves extracted facts as embeddings to LanceDB
- `extractAndSaveMemories()` — Combined pipeline: extract → save → return result
- `shouldExtractMemory()` — Check if extraction should trigger based on message count
- Robust JSON Parser with 5 fallback layers:
  - Layer 1: Direct `JSON.parse()`
  - Layer 2: Extract from markdown code fences (```json ... ```)
  - Layer 3: Find `[...]` array anywhere in text
  - Layer 4: Parse individual JSON objects line by line (handles broken JSON)
  - Layer 5: Simple line format fallback (`HECHO | importance | tipo | descripcion`)
- Validation: clamps importance 1-5, normalizes memory types (with Spanish aliases), max 200 chars per fact
- LLM prompt in Spanish, asks for concise facts only (returns `[]` if nothing memorable)

**API Route (`src/app/api/embeddings/extract-memory/route.ts`) - NEW:**
- `POST /api/embeddings/extract-memory` — Receives message + character info + LLM config
- Dynamic import to avoid loading heavy modules at startup
- Returns: `{ success, count, facts, saved, namespace, embeddingIds }`

**Type Updates (`src/types/index.ts`):**
- Added to `EmbeddingsChatSettings`:
  - `memoryExtractionEnabled?: boolean` — Toggle auto-extraction
  - `memoryExtractionFrequency?: number` — Every N messages (default: 5)
  - `memoryExtractionMinImportance?: number` — Min importance to save (default: 2)

**Chat Route Integration (`src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts`):**
- Accumulates full response content during streaming (`accumulatedContent`)
- After `done` signal, fires async extraction via `setTimeout(0)` (fire-and-forget)
- Triggers when: enabled AND response > 50 chars AND message count % frequency === 0
- Calls `/api/embeddings/extract-memory` with LLM config subset (provider, endpoint, apiKey, model, parameters)

**Group Chat Integration (`src/app/api/chat/group-stream/route.ts`):**
- Same pattern but iterates over `responsesThisTurn` array (multiple responders)
- Passes `groupId: group.id` so memories are saved to `group-{groupId}` namespace

**UI Settings (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Added "🧠 Extracción Automática de Memoria" section in Integración con Chat
- Toggle switch to enable/disable
- Frequency slider: every 2-20 messages (default: 5)
- Min importance slider: 1-5 (default: 2)
- Info box explaining: auto namespaces (character-{id}/group-{id}), importance filter, async (non-blocking)
- Default settings: disabled, frequency 5, min importance 2

**Architecture:**
- Extraction is ASYNC and FIRE-AND-FORGET — never blocks chat response
- Uses the same LLM provider configured for chat (with temperature 0.1 for consistency)
- Namespaces: `character-{id}` for normal chat, `group-{id}` for group chat
- source_type: `memory` for all auto-extracted embeddings

---
## Task ID: 14 - memory-extraction-phase2-visual-feedback
### Work Task
Fix critical bugs and add visual feedback for the memory extraction system.

### Work Summary

**Bug Fix: JSX `{id}` reference error (`embeddings-settings-panel.tsx`):**
- Line 2056 had `(character-{id} o group-{id})` which JSX parsed as JavaScript expression `id` (undefined variable)
- Fixed by escaping: `(character-{'{id}'} o group-{'{id}'})` so curly braces render as literal text

**Bug Fix: `allMessages` undefined in group-stream (`group-stream/route.ts`):**
- Line 853 referenced `allMessages` which doesn't exist in group-stream scope
- Changed to `messages` (the destructured variable from request body)
- This was a silent runtime error that would crash memory extraction in group chat

**Enhancement: SSE `memory_extracting` event (stream + group-stream routes):**
- Moved the extraction condition check BEFORE `controller.close()` so we can send SSE events
- Both routes now send `{ type: 'memory_extracting', characterName/characterNames }` event before `done` event
- Stream route: sends single `characterName`
- Group-stream route: sends `characterNames` array of extractable characters (content > 50 chars)
- Extraction still runs async via `setTimeout(0)` after stream close

**Enhancement: Visual memory extraction indicator (chat-panel.tsx):**
- Added `memoryExtractingInfo` state: `{ active: boolean, characterNames: string }`
- Handlers in both group and single chat SSE parsing sections
- On `memory_extracting` event: shows indicator, auto-hides after 8 seconds
- UI: Fixed-position pill at bottom-center with spinner animation
  - Violet background with white text
  - Shows "Extrayendo memoria — {character names}"
  - Smooth fade-in slide-up animation
  - Non-intrusive, doesn't block interaction

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/embeddings/embeddings-settings-panel.tsx` — Fixed JSX `{id}` error
- `src/app/api/chat/group-stream/route.ts` — Fixed `allMessages` bug + added SSE event
- `src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` — Added SSE `memory_extracting` event
- `src/components/tavern/chat-panel.tsx` — Added state, SSE handlers, visual indicator

## Task ID: 15 - group-editor-optimization
### Work Task
Optimize the group editor component (`src/components/tavern/group-editor.tsx`, 1515 lines) with 10 targeted improvements: bug fixes, code cleanup, UI refinements, and toast notifications.

### Work Summary

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/tavern/group-editor.tsx` — 10 optimizations applied (1515 → ~1315 lines)
- `src/components/tavern/character-panel.tsx` — Group avatar display in sidebar

**1. Fixed critical bug: Avatar not in initialValues**
- Added `avatar: existingGroup?.avatar || ''` to the existing group return path in `initialValues` useMemo
- Added `avatar: ''` to the default (new group) return path
- Before fix: `useState(initialValues.avatar || '')` always got `undefined`, so editing an existing group would lose its avatar

**2. Removed duplicate "Estilo de Conversación" from Info tab**
- Removed the Conversation Style selector from the Info tab (lines 528-563 in original)
- Kept the one in the Strategy tab (lines 997-1038) where it belongs with activation strategy config

**3. Replaced all alert() calls with useToast()**
- Added `import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast'` and `const { toast } = useToast()`
- Replaced 6 `alert()` calls with proper toast notifications using `variant: 'destructive'` for errors:
  - `handleAvatarUpload`: Image too large, unsupported format, upload error, connection error
  - `handleSave`: Name required, at least one member required

**4. Removed redundant "Resumen" card from Info tab**
- Removed the entire "Resumen" card (lines 630-656 in original) that duplicated info visible in the Strategy tab
- Cleaner avatar section without the redundant stats card

**5. Removed unused `selectedCharacterId` state and `handleAddMember`**
- Removed `const [selectedCharacterId, setSelectedCharacterId] = useState<string>('')`
- Removed the entire `handleAddMember` function (was never called — members tab uses inline buttons)

**6. Fixed embeddingNamespaces initialization for new groups**
- Added `embeddingNamespaces: []` to the default (new group) return path in `initialValues`

**7. Simplified verbose strategy color classes with helper function**
- Created `getStrategyColorClasses(color)` helper at module level with a colorMap for emerald/blue/purple/amber/cyan
- Returns `{ bg, border, text, bgLight, bgSelected }` classes for each color
- Replaced verbose multi-line `cn()` conditionals in 3 locations:
  - Strategy tip box in strategy tab
  - Strategy info card at bottom of strategy tab
  - Per-strategy icon color in strategy selector

**8. Improved Info tab layout**
- Changed from 3-column (`lg:grid-cols-3`) to 2-column (`lg:grid-cols-2`) layout
- Left column: Name + Description (cleaner without Conversation Style)
- Right column: Avatar upload (horizontal layout) + Assignments section
- Avatar now displays inline with description text instead of being a standalone column

**9. Show group avatar in character-panel.tsx sidebar**
- Updated group list item rendering to conditionally show the group's uploaded avatar

## Task ID: 16 - embeddings-recency-primacy-injection
### Work Task
Change WHERE memory embeddings are injected into the LLM prompt. Previously they were appended inside the system prompt text (after User's Persona). Now they are injected as a SEPARATE system message RIGHT BEFORE the chat history, which is more effective because LLMs pay more attention to recent context.

### Work Summary

**Problem:** Memory embeddings were being concatenated into the `finalSystemPrompt` string, burying them deep in the system message where LLMs tend to pay less attention. LLMs exhibit recency bias — they attend more to context closer to the generation point.

**Solution:** Extract embeddings from the system prompt string and inject them as a separate system message positioned right before the chat history, maximizing their influence on the LLM response.

**Files Modified:**

1. **`src/lib/llm/types.ts`** — Added `embeddingsContext?: string` to `CompletionPromptConfig` interface

2. **`src/lib/llm/prompt-builder.ts`** — Three function updates:
   - `buildChatMessages()`: Added 8th parameter `embeddingsContext?: string`. Injects as a separate `role: 'system'` message at position 1.5 (between system prompt and chat history)
   - `buildCompletionPrompt()`: Added `embeddingsContext` to config destructuring. Injects between system prompt separator (`\n---\n`) and chat messages
   - `buildGroupChatMessages()`: Added 10th parameter `embeddingsContext?: string`. Injects as a separate `role: 'system'` message at position 1.5

3. **`src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts`** — Normal chat route:
   - Removed `finalSystemPrompt += ... embeddingsResult.section ...` (no longer appended to system prompt)
   - Built separate `embeddingsContextString` variable
   - Updated all 5 provider calls (z-ai, openai/vllm/custom, anthropic, ollama, text-generation-webui/koboldcpp) to pass `embeddingsContextString`
   - Moved embeddings section in prompt viewer from after persona to before chat history

4. **`src/app/api/chat/group-stream/route.ts`** — Group chat route:
   - Removed embeddings from `finalSystemPrompt` concatenation
   - Built separate `embeddingsContextString` variable
   - Updated `buildGroupChatMessages()` call to pass `embeddingsContextString` as last parameter
   - Moved embeddings section in prompt viewer from after persona to before chat history

5. **`src/app/api/chat/regenerate/route.ts`** — Regenerate route:
   - Removed `finalSystemPrompt += ... embeddingsResult.section ...`
   - Built separate `embeddingsContextString` variable
   - Updated all 5 provider calls to pass `embeddingsContextString`
   - Moved embeddings section in prompt viewer to before chat history

**New Prompt Message Order:**
```
[System Prompt]           ← position 1 (persona, description, scenario, etc.)
[Embeddings Context]      ← NEW position 1.5 (separate system message, recency primacy)
[Chat History]            ← position 2+ (user/assistant messages)
[Author's Note]           ← after chat history
[Post-History Instructions] ← last, before generation
```

**Unchanged:**
- SSE `embeddings_context` events remain the same (client UI unchanged)
- Memory extraction logic unchanged
- Embeddings retrieval logic unchanged
- Only the POSITION in the final LLM messages array changed

**ESLint:** Passes with zero errors
